### **CSS Application Methods and Style Precedence Coding Challenges**

**Objective:**  
Students will demonstrate their understanding of inline, internal, and external styles, recognize the differences between these methods, and explore style precedence and specificity rules through coding challenges.

### **Instructions for Completing the CSS Challenges**

1. **Folder Structure:**  
   Each challenge has its own folder. Open the folder for the current challenge you’re working on.

2. **Read Instructions:**  
   Inside each folder, you’ll find a file named `README.txt` or comments in the provided code. These will guide you on what to do for that specific challenge.

3. **Run Your Code:**

   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view your work.
   - Test all styles and interactions to ensure they work as expected.

4. **Validate Your Code:**

   - Use the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your HTML for errors.
   - Use the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate your CSS.

5. **Explore Bonus Features:**  
   For the bonus challenges, use [W3SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com/) to explore additional CSS properties and experiment with them in your code.

6. **Save and Document Your Work:**
   - Save all changes and ensure your files are well-organized.
   - Add comments in your code to explain your styles and choices.

**Remember:** Understanding and experimenting are key! Feel free to ask questions if you get stuck.
