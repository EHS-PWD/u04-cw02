      <h2>Diet</h2>
      <p>
        Russian tortoises are herbivores and enjoy a diet rich in leafy greens such as kale, dandelion greens, and romaine lettuce. 
        Avoid feeding them fruit, as their digestive systems are not designed for sugary foods.

        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Provide a calcium supplement to keep their shells strong and healthy.

      <h2>Care Tips</h2>
      <p>
        Caring for a Russian tortoise requires setting up a proper enclosure. A large indoor habitat with a heat lamp and UVB lighting 
        is essential. Ensure the substrate is safe and allows them to burrow.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature: 70-85Â°F during the day.</li>
        <li>Lighting: UVB exposure for 10-12 hours a day.</li>
        <li>Humidity: Keep it low to prevent respiratory issues.</li>
      </ul>
