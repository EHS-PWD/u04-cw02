### **Challenge 1: Setting Up Inline, Internal, and External Styles**  
**Task:**  
1. Create an HTML file named `index.html`.  
2. Add the following elements:  
   - A `<div>` with the text "This is a styled div."  
   - A `<p>` with the text "This is a styled paragraph."  
   - A `<h1>` with the text "Welcome to CSS."  
3. Apply the following styles:  
   - Use **inline styles** to make the text of the `<div>` blue and add a border.  
   - Use **internal styles** to set the font size of the `<p>` to 18px and its background to light gray.  
   - Link an **external stylesheet** (e.g., `styles.css`) to make the `<h1>` text bold and center it.  

**Goal:**  
Successfully implement all three CSS methods in one document.
